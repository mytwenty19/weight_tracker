# Weight Tracker
This repository is an attempt at tracking personal weight across 2019.

For now, there's no real weight tracking, just a set of date utilities to help me get started.

# Getting Started
First get **python3** and **pip** setup.

Then get the dependencies from the [requirements file](requirements.txt) like so:
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Date Utilities
[date_utils.py](date_utils.py) contains a simple set of date utilities to play around with. See [this notebook](play_with_date_utils.ipynb) for more some simple examples.
